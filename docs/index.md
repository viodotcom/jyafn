# The JYAFN docs

Oh, hi! I didn't see you there! Welcome to the JYAFN in-repo docs. Here are some links to get you started:

* [Why JYAFN?](./why-jyafn.md): start here.
* [The JYAFN starter tutorial](./the-jyafn-starter-tutorial.md): if you are a DS trying to use JYAFN.
* [Deploying a JYAFN in Go](./deploying-a-jyafn-in-go.md): if you are developer that has to deploy JYAFN models. Hopefully this document falls into obscurity as we automate stuff.
* [To serve JYAFN](./to-serve-jyafn.md): the JYAFN cookbook, or "how do I do X?" Q&A section.

And, of course, the [readme](../readme.md) also contains some very useful information on how to get started.
