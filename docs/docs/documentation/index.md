# Docs and where to find them

Documentation for JYAFN are stored a few different places:

* There are all the tutorials available in [this website](../tutorials/index.md), which will guide you from zero to hero.
* You can check out the documentation for the Rust API in [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/jyafn).
* For Python, Pylance can recognize the docstrings in the `jyafn` package and give you directions on how to use the tools in there.
* You can also check out the `jyafn` CLI tool and give it a `jyafn --help`  to see all available options.

In this section, we present the following:

* Documentation on [extensions](./extensions/index.md).
* A ["cookbook"](./to-serve-jyafn.md) for common problems and solutions faced when developing with JYAFN.
