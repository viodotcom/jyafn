Oh, hi! I didn't see you there! Welcome to the JYAFN in-repo docs. Here are some links to get you started:

* [Why JYAFN?](./getting-started/why-jyafn.md): explains the idea behind the project.
* [The JYAFN starter tutorial](./tutorials/index.md): if you are a DS trying to use JYAFN.
* [Working with extensions](./tutorials/working-with-extensions.md): if you are a DS looking for extra functionality in your code (e.g., wanting to run a LightGBM model? Don't implement it from scratch!).
* [Deploying a JYAFN in Go](./tutorials/deploying-a-jyafn-in-go.md): if you are developer that has to deploy JYAFN models. Hopefully this document falls into obscurity as we automate stuff.
* [To serve JYAFN](./documentation/to-serve-jyafn.md): the JYAFN cookbook, or "how do I do X?" Q&A section.

And, of course, the [readme](https://github.com/viodotcom/jyafn/readme.md) also contains some very useful information on how to get started.
